Hello, I am Hayden, a senior at Hendrix College, majoring in mathematics and computer science. I am actively involved on campus, serving as the captain of the ultimate frisbee team, a member of Disco Tray Studios, and a participant in Revolutionary Reads, a campus book club. I also engage in other various computer science and math-related activities outside of the ones.

Outside of academics, I have a passion for the outdoors and make annual trips to Minnesota for a week of canoeing and camping. This past summer, I completed a programming internship at Engine in Rogers, Arkansas, where I contributed to their PlanoFX app.
