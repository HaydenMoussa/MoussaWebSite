Last week we got the Hendrix Arboretum website to a good place. So myself and the team working on the Arboretum moved onto to iSeeGreen website. I have spent the past week familarizing myself with the repository, submitting issues, and fixing small bugs or typos where I see them. I am starting to look into adding a comments feature on the list aspect of the site.

Thanks for reading!
