This week was the first week back from summer vacation, at the end of last semster I finished up the Faulkner County Juveline Court database and website, so I am moving onto a new project, the Hendrix Arobetum website. I have not worked on this project at all so I spent most of my time working on it this week trying to get images to show up on it when i host it locally. But I have not sucessed yet, I am looking into the startup.cs file to try and see if the issue has something to do with the connection strings used to connect to the databse that contains the tree images. I will now start working on updating the website from .net 5 to .net 8. Besides that I have updated my blog using a new jekyll template.
