This week was the first week back from summer vacation, at the end of last semster I finished up the Faulkner County Juveline Court database and website, so I am moving onto a new project, the Hendrix Arobetum website. I have not worked on this project at all so I spent most of my time working on it this week trying to get images to show up on my locally hosted website. But I have not sucessed yet. Besides that I have updated my blog using a new jekyll blog.
