This week, I created a Buildings table and a Directions table in Azure Data Studio. I had never used the application before, but it was pretty intuitive and did not take much time to learn. After creating the tables, I populated them with their respective data. In the Buildings table, I entered all the unique buildings from the Locations table, and in the Directions table, I added the cardinal directions. After that, I mapped all the directions and buildings to the correct tree based on their location in the Locations table.


Next, I started updating the website to include a Buildings page where a user can add a building. I am still working on getting the editing, details, and delete pages to function properly. Coming up, I will be working on how to assign a building and direction to new trees in the future.


Thanks!
