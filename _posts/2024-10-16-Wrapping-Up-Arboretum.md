This week, I finished up splitting the location table into building and direction. I then reached out the the help desk about getting an azure account that could be shared by disco tray members. I submitted a pull request for my location databse changes but there were some conflicts. Right before I submitted my pull request the branch updated and when I merged the new branch with my current branch with the location changes things broke. So I am currently working on fixing that up.

Thanks fo reading!
