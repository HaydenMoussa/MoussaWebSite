After taking a week-long break, Kolya met with Professor Willyard to discuss the next steps in the website's development. From that discussion, there were some key takeaways:



1. There needs to be a way for her to test the project.



2. There should be predictive text and spelling checks for family and genera.



3. There should be a checkbox-style option to add plants to a list from the search screen.



4. There needs to be a way to export lists as a CSV file.



I started working on enhancement number 3, creating a way to add plants to a list from the search page. Currently, I have a way to select a list on the search page but am encountering issues with selecting the correct plant on the search page.
