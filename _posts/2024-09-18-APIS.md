This week I have been working on getting the hendrix arboretum website to find the closest tree to you and display it on the map. I am not familar at all with api's so this has been a learning experiance. Fist I had to find the correct api, then I had to learn how to get the api information then return it as json. I have not finished this process but I have learned a lot. I am working on the front end function right now that gets the tree based on the api data.
